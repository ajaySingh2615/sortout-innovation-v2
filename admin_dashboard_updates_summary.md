### 5. UI Enhancements

#### Instagram Profile Display:
```php
<?php if ($row['professional'] === 'Artist' && !empty($row['instagram_profile'])): ?>
    <a href="<?= htmlspecialchars($row['instagram_profile']) ?>" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">
        <i class="fab fa-instagram mr-1"></i>View
    </a>
<?php else: ?>
    N/A
<?php endif; ?>
```

#### Work Type Preference Display:
```php
<?php if ($row['professional'] === 'Artist' && !empty($row['work_type_preference'])): ?>
    <span class="text-xs bg-gray-100 px-2 py-1 rounded" title="<?= htmlspecialchars($row['work_type_preference']) ?>">
        <?= strlen($row['work_type_preference']) > 20 ? substr(htmlspecialchars($row['work_type_preference']), 0, 20) . '...' : htmlspecialchars($row['work_type_preference']) ?>
    </span>
<?php else: ?>
    N/A
<?php endif; ?>
