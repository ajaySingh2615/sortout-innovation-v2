# Fix Summary: Artist Fields Showing N/A Issue

## Problem
The new Artist fields (Email, Influencer Category, Influencer Type, Instagram Profile, Expected Payment, Work Type Preference) were showing "N/A" in the admin dashboard even though the data was stored in the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `admin/fetch_clients.php` file. This file is used for dynamic loading/pagination in the admin dashboard, but it was only selecting specific fields and **not including the new Artist fields** in the SELECT query.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `admin/fetch_clients.php`
**File:** `admin/fetch_clients.php`

**Before:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, age, gender, professional, category, role, city, followers, 
       experience, language, image_url, resume_url, current_salary, is_visible 
FROM clients
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, age, gender, professional, category, role, city, followers, 
       experience, language, image_url, resume_url, current_salary, is_visible,
       email, influencer_category, influencer_type, instagram_profile, 
       expected_payment, work_type_preference, phone
FROM clients
```

### 2. Updated Search Functionality
**File:** `admin/fetch_clients.php`

Added the new fields to the search condition so admins can search by these fields:
```sql
name LIKE '%$search%' OR 
gender LIKE '%$search%' OR 
professional LIKE '%$search%' OR 
category LIKE '%$search%' OR 
role LIKE '%$search%' OR 
city LIKE '%$search%' OR
email LIKE '%$search%' OR
influencer_category LIKE '%$search%' OR
influencer_type LIKE '%$search%' OR
expected_payment LIKE '%$search%' OR
work_type_preference LIKE '%$search%'
```

## What Was Already Working
- The main dashboard queries using `SELECT *` were already working correctly
- The form submission and database storage were working correctly
- The JavaScript rendering logic was already handling the new fields correctly
- The conditional logic in the dashboard was correct

## Testing Steps

### 1. Run the Test Script
Visit: `your-domain.com/test_artist_fields.php`

This will:
- Check if the new columns exist in the database
- Display sample Artist records with the new fields
- Show if data is actually stored

### 2. Test the Admin Dashboard
1. Go to the admin dashboard
2. Check both "Pending Approvals" and "Approved Clients" tables
3. Look for Artist profiles and verify the new fields show actual data instead of "N/A"
4. Test the search functionality with the new fields
5. Test pagination to ensure all pages load correctly

### 3. Expected Results
For Artist profiles, you should now see:
- **Email**: Actual email addresses instead of "N/A"
- **Influencer Category**: Selected categories instead of "N/A"
- **Influencer Type**: Selected types instead of "N/A"
- **Instagram**: Clickable links instead of "N/A"
- **Expected Payment**: Payment ranges instead of "N/A"
- **Work Type**: Truncated work preferences instead of "N/A"

For Employee profiles, these fields should still show "N/A" (which is correct).

## Files Modified
1. `admin/fetch_clients.php` - Updated SELECT query and search conditions
2. `test_artist_fields.php` - Created for testing (can be deleted after testing)

## Notes
- The main dashboard queries were already working because they use `SELECT *`
- Only the dynamic loading/pagination was affected
- No database schema changes were needed
- No frontend changes were needed
